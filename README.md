Hi! First of all, this was the project given to us to **make a website about us**, but I thought that was too basic and wanted to create something tougher, like recreating the Apple website (IPHONE 13). However, as you can see, it failed, or much more succinctly, the design was taking too much time from me, and I was a developer, not a designer.

So, I proceeded to skip this project, or much more succinctly, I left this project here as I was reading up on the difference between a web app and a website, and lecture 9 invoked my curiosity. Nonetheless, here is the link to the [Project](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/psets/8/homepage/)
