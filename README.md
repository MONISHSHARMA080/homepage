Hi! first of all this was the project give to us to **make a website about us ** but I thouht that was too basic and wanted to create something tough alike recreating the apple website(IPHONE 13 )but as you can see failed or much more succintly design was taing too much time from me and i was a developer not dsigner 

So i proceed to skip this project of much more succintly I say __Left this projewct here__ as i was reading up on difference between web app and website and leacture 9 invoked my curiosity
